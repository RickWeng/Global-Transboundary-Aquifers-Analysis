## Abstract
Globally, almost two billion people depend on groundwater as their primary freshwater source. Atop many aquifers, expansion of anthropogenic land uses such as agriculture and urban development have contributed to widespread groundwater quality problems (high concentrations of chemicals or nutrients like nitrates). When combined with deforestation, such land use changes further diminish the ability of forests to mitigate aquifer contamination. Here, we conduct the first quantitative global analysis of land use conversion and forest loss above 592 transboundary aquifers from 2000 to 2014, to answer three primary questions: To what extent are transboundary aquifers impacted by different types of land use? Which land use type are associated with high rates of forest loss? Do these trends differ for deep and shallow aquifers?    
More than half of the total land surface above transboundary aquifers has been converted to more intensive land uses over the past three centuries. In year 2000, rangelands accounted for the highest proportional area (29%) of any land use types. Forty-two transboundary aquifers lost more than 50% of total forest cover in 14 years. While differing widely, aquifers with high proportional forest loss (>40%) were primarily in Western Africa, Southern Africa, Middle East and Europe. Transboundary aquifers in Southeast Asia showed the highest annual rates of deforestation. Transboundary aquifers with significantly increasing annual rates of deforestation were predominately in anthromes consisting of croplands (0.020% increase per annum), dense settlements (0.019% increase per annum), and seminatural lands (0.013% increase per annum). More intensive land uses were significantly associated with the shallower aquifers, coincidentally the aquifers likely to be at great risk of contamination. Our findings reinforce the need for improved cooperation between countries sharing groundwater resources.

## Goal
Provided one of the first quantitative assessment of land use and forest cover change in global transboundary aquifers.
